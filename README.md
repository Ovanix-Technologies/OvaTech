REPO RULES
----------------
DO NOT commit any applications. The ONLY things we should commit are art, code, .blends etc.
That means no config files, exes, nothing. Only art that we've made, .blends we've made, and open source art are allowed in this repo!

BLENDER RULES
----------------
PLEASE name EVERY object!


Make sure to use the right .blend for working. Here are explanations for the purpose of each file:

gameplay.blend - Only core, clean, finished mechanics should be imported here. This blend will be copied when you start a new prototype as it will be the base of the game.
sandboxM.blend - Used for prototyping gameplay mechanics or modeling (Macoy only). Keep all prototypes! Make a new scene for each experiment.
sandboxK.blend - Used for prototyping gameplay mechanics or modeling (Kyle only). Keep all prototypes! Make a new scene for each experiment.

graphicalAssets.blend - Keep any ready models and textures here (NOT for art from other sources). Model in your sandbox, then append the asset. 
otherAssets.blend - Keep audio, video, text etc. here
outsideAssets.blend - Keep assets created by others here. This includes placeholder art. Make sure to paste a link to the source in a text file

Modellers should create their own sandboxX.blend files for modeling
