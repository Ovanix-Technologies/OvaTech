Magic, atleast that is what we call it now, was a technology created by the Ancients. When humans could finally control the energy around them, the world changed forever. The utilization of guns was now obsolete; one could always control if the gun even fired.

When I awoke I was in a forest near a coast with no memory of any life before that time, as if I had never lived anywhere else than where I now found myself.  As I began to wander in search for shelter or... well, really anything, I stumbled apon a small town. However, I could tell that something was wrong. The people of the town, the frightened and disgusted looks they gave me, as if I was some kind of monster.  Crani, they called me, as if I would know what that meant. It didn't seem like they were calling me by name. Rather I started to suspect that there were others like me.
