Magic, atleast that is what we call it now, was a technology created by the Ancient's.  It change how the world worked when human's could finally control the energy around them without a machine. Guns never worked anymore, one could always control if the gun even fired.

When I woke up I was in a forest near a coast, no memory of any life before that time almost like I had never lived anywhere else then where I found myself now.  As I began to wander in search for shelter, or...well really anything, I stumbled apon a small town. There was something wrong though. The people of the town...the frightened or disgusted looks they gave me as if I was some kind of monster.  Crani, they called me as if I would know what that meant. It didn't seem like they were calling me by name, rather I started to suspect thier were others like me.
